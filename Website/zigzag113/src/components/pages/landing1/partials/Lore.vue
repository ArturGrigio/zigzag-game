            The world was once a peaceful place where defining Shapes and vibrant Colors made up the abundant forests, soaring mountains, wide plains, and the ever-changing seasons. The ones who upheld this peace were the Cube, Pyramid, and Sphere. These three leaders ensured the world maintained its prosperity and happiness by driving away those who feed on it, the Slimes.

            The Slimes are Shapeless and Colorless creatures who seek to consume the environment that defies their existence. The three Shapes worked to purge their sworn enemies, and one day, the Slimes were driven to the very edge of the world, close to extinction. However, one Slime in its desperation, jealousy, and spite against the Shapes planned a secret attack against the leaders, consuming the Pyramid, Sphere, and a part of the Cube. This dealt a fatal blow to the world which caused the Slimes to absorb all Color from the world while only leaving a few Shapes left to defend for themselves. Now the Slimes seek an eye for an eye by ridding the world of Shapes and Color as has happened to them; this became known as the Shapeless Era.

            Among the survivors was the leader, Cube, but having lost its Color it can no longer defend for itself. After spending years running away from the consuming Slimes, the Cube has taken refuge in the mountains only to plan the next escape if the Slimes were to find it. One day, as the Cube slept in a cave, it had a dream where it was approached by a Colored figure who also resembled a cube, but somehow seem deformed in shape.

            The figure told the cube, “This is not the way it should be. Take back your color, and bring things to their rightful place…”

                    The Cube is one of the few remaining Shapes existence, but one day it regained its Color back. Now it is attempting to restore balance to the world of Shapes and Color by finding its lost allies to support the cause.

                    The Pyramid and Sphere were leaders along the Cube before the Shapeless Era; these beings were pillars that maintained prosperity to the world of Shapes. They were consumed by Slimes and are thought to be lost forever along with the peaceful world they upheld.
