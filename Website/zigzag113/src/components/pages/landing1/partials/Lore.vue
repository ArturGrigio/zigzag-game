            The world was once a peaceful place filled with unique Shapes and vibrant Colors that made up the abundant forests, soaring mountains, stretching plains, and ever-changing seasons. The ones who upheld this peace were Cube, Pyramid, and Sphere. These three leaders ensured the world maintained its prosperity and happiness by driving away those who feed on it, the Slimes.

            The Slimes are Shapeless and Colorless creatures who seek to consume the environment that defies their existence. The three Shapes worked to purge their sworn enemies, and one day, the Slimes were driven to the very edge of the world bringing them close to extinction. However, one Slime in its desperation, jealousy, and spite against the Shapes launched a secret attack against the leaders. This attack consumed Pyramid and Sphere, while stripping away Cube’s power. This dealt a fatal blow to the world which caused the Slimes to absorb all Color from the world while only leaving a few Colorless Shapes left to defend for themselves. Now the Slimes seek an eye for an eye by ridding the world of Shapes and Color as has happened to them; this became known as the Shapeless Era.

            Among the survivors was the leader, Cube, but having lost its Color it can no longer defend for itself. After spending years running away from the consuming Slimes, the Cube has taken refuge in the mountains only to plan its next escape if the Slimes were discover it. But on one fateful day as the Cube slept in a cave, it had a dream where it was approached by a Colored figure who resembled a cube, but somehow seem deformed in shape.

            The figure told the cube, “This is not the way it should be. Take back your color, and bring things to their rightful place… Restore balance to the world.”

                    The Cube is one of the few remaining Shapes existence, but one day it regained its Color back. Now it is attempting to restore balance to the world of Shapes and Color by finding its lost allies to support the cause.

                    The Pyramid and Sphere were leaders along the Cube before the Shapeless Era; these beings were pillars that maintained prosperity to the world of Shapes. They were consumed by Slimes and are thought to be lost forever along with the peaceful world they upheld.

                    The Slimes are Shapeless and Colorless beings who consume Shapes and their Color in order to sustain themselves. However, their method of sustenance has lead to their existence being viewed as enemies of the world from all Shapes. As a result, the three leaders attempted purge to the Slimes in an act of justice, but instead they drove the Slimes to madness and collapsed the world into a Shapeless and Colorless Era.
